This document is hidden, but not restricted. You can access it if you have a special link that adds it to the menu. It will only appear in the menu if you accessed it via such a link. You build a link, you use (for example):

```
http://URL_EXAMPLE/ft3/interface.html?assignment=DIRECTORY
```

where `DIRECTORY` is the directory containing the assignment. If you've included spaces or other special characters in the directory name, you'll need to `URLencode()` it before putting it in the link:

```{r}
URLencode('my assignment directory')
```

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding for more detail.
