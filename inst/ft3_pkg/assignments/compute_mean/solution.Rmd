```{r echo=FALSE}
y |> sum() -> S
y |> mean() |> round(3) -> M
```

To take the mean of `r knitr::combine_words(y)`, we:

1. add up the numbers: `r paste(y, collapse=' + ')` = `r S`, then
2. divide by the total count of numbers you added up in step (1): `r S`/`r N` = `r M`, then
3. report the mean: `r M`.

The general formula for computing a mean is

\[
M = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i
\]

where $M$ is the mean, $N$ is how many numbers we have, and $x_i$ is the number with index $i$ (first number, second number, etc).
